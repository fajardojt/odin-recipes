        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An American classic, this easy sandwich is so good you'll make five of them in one night.</p>
        <p>Read on to learn how to make your own peanut butter and jelly sandwich!</p>

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Jelly</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On one piece of bread, smear a generous portion of peanut butter.</li>
            <li>On a second piece of bread, smear a light portion of jelly.  If you want a sweeter sandwich, smear more jelly.</li>
            <li>Put the two pieces of bread together.</li></li>
        </ol>
        <p>TIP: If you are not eating your sandwich right away, spread peanut butter on both pieces of bread and put jelly on top of them.
            The peanut buter acts as a lipid layer that protects the bread from the watery jelly, preventing it from getting soggy.</p>
